## Description

This project is an interactive, branching story built using p5.js. The user is presented with a series of screens that represent different scenes in the story. At key moments, the user must make choices that determine which scene appears next, ultimately leading to different endings. The design is inspired by choose-your-own-adventure narratives and focuses on demonstrating how game states and user input can control narrative flow.
